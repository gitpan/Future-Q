Revision history for Future-Q

0.020    2013/05/12
         - Support Future 0.13
           POD is updated now that Future has its own then() method.
         - [BUG FIX] It crashed when a Future object (not a Future::Q object) was returned
           from then() callbacks. This bug is fixed.
         - Drop support for Future::Utils::repeat() in the test suite. repeat() may not
           go well with Future::Q's feature of reporting unhandled failures.
         - Now Module::Build is used for packaging.
