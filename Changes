Revision history for Future-Q

0.040    2013/07/15
         - [BUG FIX] Now Carp::croak() called in callback functions for try(), fcall(),
           then() and catch() methods report the error from the user's perspective.
           Note that you have to include 'Future::Q' in @CARP_NOT of the package
           that calls try(), fcall(), then() or catch().
         - Perhaps error reporting might need a little more brush-up...

         - No changes to the code.
         - Update POD in response to Future 0.14 and q.js v0.9.5
         - Confirmed it passes the tests with Future 0.15 installed.

         - Support Future 0.13
           POD is updated now that Future has its own then() method.
         - [BUG FIX] It crashed when a Future object (not a Future::Q object) was returned
           from then() callbacks. This bug is fixed.
         - Drop support for Future::Utils::repeat() in the test suite. repeat() may not
           go well with Future::Q's feature of reporting unhandled failures.
         - Now Module::Build is used for packaging.
